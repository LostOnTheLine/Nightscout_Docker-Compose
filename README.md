# Nightscout_Docker-Compose
A comprehensive Docker-Compose for Nightscout CGM (Glucose Monitoring)

My intent is to include all the possible values you may want while giving enough information to decide if you do or not.

You can delete any lines you do not need, as I feel it much easier to delete what you don't need than it is to go searching for what you do, especially since nowhere seems to contain it all & formatting is never clearly stated anywhere


Basic `docker-compose`

```yaml
services:
  test:
    - yes
```
